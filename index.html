      Red Dead Redemption 2[a] is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and
      published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red Dead
      series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. The story is
      set in 1899 and follows the exploits of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of
      the Van der Linde gang, in a fictionalized representation of the Western,
      Midwestern, and Southern United States. Arthur must deal with the decline
      of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces,
      rival gangs, and other adversaries. The game's epilogue follows fellow
      gang member John Marston, the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption. The game
      is presented through both first and third-person perspectives, and the
      player may freely roam in its interactive open world. Gameplay elements
      include shootouts, robberies, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with
      non-player characters, and maintaining the character's honor rating
      through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system similar to the "wanted"
      system from the Grand Theft Auto franchise governs the response of law
      enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. Red Dead
      Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 32 players engage
      in a variety of cooperative and competitive game modes. The game's
      development lasted over eight years, beginning soon after Red Dead
      Redemption's release, and it became one of the most expensive video games
      ever made. Rockstar co-opted all of its studios into one large team to
      facilitate development. They drew influence from real locations as opposed
      to film or art, focused on creating an accurate reflection of the time
      with the game's characters and world. The game was Rockstar's first built
      specifically for eighth generation consoles, having tested their technical
      capabilities while porting Grand Theft Auto V to the platforms. The game's
      soundtrack features an original score composed by Woody Jackson and
      several vocal tracks produced by Daniel Lanois. Development included a
      crunch schedule of 100-hour weeks, leading to reports of mandatory and
      unpaid overtime. Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4
      and Xbox One in October 2018, and for Windows and Stadia in November 2019.
      It broke several records and had the second-biggest launch in the history
      of entertainment, generating US$725 million in sales from its opening
      weekend and exceeding the lifetime sales of Red Dead Redemption in two
      weeks. The game received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its
      story, characters, open world, graphics, music, and level of detail; some
      criticism was directed at its control scheme and emphasis on realism over
      player freedom. It won year-end accolades including Game of the Year
      awards from several gaming publications, and is considered an example of
      video games as an art form as well as one of the greatest video games ever
      made. It is also among the best-selling video games with over 45 million
      copies shipped.
