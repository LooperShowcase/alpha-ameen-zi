    <p>New Halloween Hardcore Telegram Mission Coming October 18, Plus New All Hallows' Call to Arms Locations, The Halloween Pass 2 Returns, and More

<p>Triple Rewards on Bounties and A Merry Call to Arms, Plus a Festive Community Outfit Giveaway, and More</p>
<hr>
<p>Soon the hills and valleys of the five states will be covered in snow — first arriving in a light fall mid-month, and then later a heavy flurry. Bounty Hunters out braving the cold to enforce justice are being rewarded, while the chill also brings with it the warmth of holiday spirit.

Both Legendary and Infamous Bounty Missions are paying out 3X RDO$, XP, and Gold, dead or alive. Dogged Bounty Hunters who complete 3 different Legendary Bounties during any week in December will also receive a red colorway of the Folwell Hat.

New players can begin their law enforcement career by visiting the Sheriff’s Office in Rhodes and purchasing the Bounty Hunter License directly from him, or from any Bounty Board afterwards. Intrepid Bounty Hunters can then claim 10 Gold Bars off the Prestigious Bounty Hunter License to show their dedication to wrangling those disturbing the peace.</p>
